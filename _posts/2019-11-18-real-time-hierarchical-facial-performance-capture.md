  Real-time hierarchical facial
  performance capture
author: gicomadmin
post_excerpt: >
  This paper presents a novel method to
  reconstruct high resolution facial
  geometry and appearance in real-time by
  capturing an individual-specific face
  model with fine-scale details, based on
  monocular RGB video input. Specifically,
  after reconstructing the coarse facial
  model from the input video, we
  subsequently refine it using
  shape-from-shading techniques, where
  illumination, albedo texture, and
  displacements are recovered by
  minimizing the difference between the
  synthesized face and the input RGB
  video. In order to recover wrinkle level
  details, we build a hierarchical face
  pyramid through adaptive subdivisions
  and progressive refinements of the mesh
  from a coarse level to a fine level. We
  both quantitatively and qualitatively
  evaluate our method through many
  experiments on various inputs. We
  demonstrate that our approach can
  produce results close to off-line
  methods and better than previous
  real-time methods.
