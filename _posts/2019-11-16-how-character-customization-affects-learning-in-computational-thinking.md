  How character customization affects
  learning in computational thinking
author: gicomadmin
post_excerpt: >
  The ability to select or customize
  characters in educational applications
  and games has been shown to in uence
  factors related to learning e ects such
  as transfer, self-e cacy, and
  motivation. Most previous conclusions on
  the perception of virtual characters and
  the e ect of character assignment in
  interactive applications have been
  reached through short, one-task
  experiments. To investigate more
  long-term e ects of assigning versus
  customizing characters as well as
  explore perceptions of personal
  character appearance, we conduct a study
  in which sixth and seventh grade
  students are introduced to programming
  concepts with the software VEnvI
  (Virtual Environment Interactions) in
  seven one-hour sessions over two weeks.
  In VEnvI, students create performances
  for virtual characters by assembling
  blocks. With a between-subjects design,
  in which some of the students can alter
  their character and others are not given
  that possibility, we examine the in
  uence of the presence or absence of
  character choice options on learning.
