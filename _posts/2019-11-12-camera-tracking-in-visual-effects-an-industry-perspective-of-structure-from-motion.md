post_title: 'Camera Tracking in Visual Effects &#8211; An Industry Perspective of Structure From Motion'
author: gicomadmin
post_excerpt: 'The ‘Matchmove’, or camera-tracking process is a crucial task andone of the first to be performed in the visual effects pipeline.  Anaccurate solve for camera movement is imperative and will havean impact on almost every other part of the pipeline downstream.In this work we present a comprehensive analysis of the processat a major visual effects studio, drawing on a large dataset of realshots.  We also present guidelines and rules-of-thumb for cameratracking scheduling which are, in what we believe to be an industryfirst,  backed by statistical data drawn from our dataset.   We alsomake available data from our pipeline which shows the amount oftime spent on camera tracking and the types of shot that are mostcommon in our work. We hope this will be of interest to the widercomputer  vision  research  community  and  will  assist  in  directingfuture research'
