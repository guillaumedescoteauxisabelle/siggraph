post_excerpt: >
  We explore the future of fabrication, in
  particular the vision of mobile
  fabrication, which we define as
  “personal fabrication on the go”. We
  explore this vision with two surveys,
  two simple hardware prototypes, matching
  custom apps that provide users with
  access to a solution database, custom
  fabrication processes we designed
  specifically for these devices, and a
  user study conducted in situ on metro
  trains. Our findings suggest that mobile
  fabrication is a compelling next
  direction for personal fabrication. From
  our experience with the prototypes we
  derive the hardware requirements to make
  mobile fabrication technically feasible.
