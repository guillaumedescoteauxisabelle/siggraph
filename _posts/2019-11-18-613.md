  3D mesh animation compression based on
  adaptive spatio-temporal segmentation

  With the recent advances of data
  acquisition techniques, the compression
  of various 3D mesh animation data has
  become an important topic in computer
  graphics community. In this paper, we
  present a new spatio-temporal
  segmentation-based approach for the
  compression of 3D mesh animations. Given
  an input mesh sequence, we first compute
  an initial temporal cut to obtain a
  small subsequence by detecting the
  temporal boundary of dynamic behavior.
  Then, we apply a two-stage vertex
  clustering on the resulting subsequence
  to classify the vertices into groups
  with optimal intraaffinities. After
  that, we design a temporal segmentation
  step based on the variations of the
  principle components within each vertex
  group prior to performing a PCA-based
  compression. Our approach can adaptively
  determine the temporal and spatial
  segmentation boundaries in order to
  exploit both temporal and spatial
  redundancies. We have conducted many
  experiments on different types of 3D
  mesh animations with various
  segmentation configurations. Our
  comparative studies show the competitive
  performance of our approach for the
  compression of 3D mesh animations.
