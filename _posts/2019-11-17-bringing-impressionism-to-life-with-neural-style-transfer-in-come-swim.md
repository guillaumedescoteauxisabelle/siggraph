  Bringing impressionism to life with
  neural style transfer in Come Swim
author: gicomadmin
post_excerpt: >
  Neural Style Transfer is a striking,
  recently-developed technique that uses
  neural networks to artistically redraw
  an image in the style of a source style
  image. This paper explores the use of
  this technique in a production setting,
  applying Neural Style Transfer to redraw
  key scenes in Come Swim in the style of
  the impressionistic painting that
  inspired the film. We present a case
  study on how the technique can be driven
  within the framework of an iterative
  creative process to achieve a desired
  look and propose a mapping of the broad
  parameter space to a key set of creative
  controls. We hope this study can provide
  insights for others who wish to use the
  technique in a production setting and
  guide priorities for future research.
