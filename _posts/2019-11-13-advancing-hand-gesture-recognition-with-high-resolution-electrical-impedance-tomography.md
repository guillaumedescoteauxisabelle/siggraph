  Advancing Hand Gesture Recognition with
  High Resolution Electrical Impedance
  Tomography
author: gicomadmin
post_excerpt: >
  Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT)
  was recently employed in the HCI domain
  to detect hand gestures using an
  instrumented smartwatch. This prior work
  demonstrated great promise for
  non-invasive, high accuracy recognition
  of gestures for interactive control. We
  introduce a new system that offers
  improved sampling speed and resolution.
  In turn, this enables superior interior
  reconstruction and gesture recognition.
  More importantly, we use our new system
  as a vehicle for experimentation â€“ we
  compare two EIT sensing methods and
  three different electrode resolutions.
  Results from in-depth empirical
  evaluations and a user study shed light
  on the future feasibility of EIT for
  sensing human input.
