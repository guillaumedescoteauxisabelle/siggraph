post_excerpt: >
  Allumette is an immersive, highly
  emotional, and visually complex virtual
  reality movie that takes place in a city
  ﬂoating amongst clouds. The story
  unfolds around you, and as the viewer,
  you are free to experience the action
  from a perspective of your choosing.
  This means you can move around and view
  the clouds from all angles, while the
  set and characters interact intimately
  with the landscape. This type of set is
  a formidable challenge for traditional
  animated ﬁlms where you have huge
  resources and hours to render each
  frame, which makes achieving the look
  and feel of immersive clouds in VR
  uncharted territory full of difﬁcult
  challenges. Existing lightweight
  techniques for real time clouds, such as
  using geometric shells with translucency
  shaders, and sprite-based methods, have
  a combination of poor quality and bad
  performance in VR, which led us to seek
  novel methods to tackle the problem. For
  Allumette, we ﬁrst modeled clouds in
  virtual reality by painting cloud shells
  using a proprietary modeling tool, then
  used a third party procedural modeling
  package to create and light the cloud
  voxel grids. Finally, these grids were
  exported with a custom ﬁle format, and
  rendered using a ray marcher in our game
  engine. The resulting clouds take .6ms
  per eye to render, and immerse the
  viewer in our cloud city.
