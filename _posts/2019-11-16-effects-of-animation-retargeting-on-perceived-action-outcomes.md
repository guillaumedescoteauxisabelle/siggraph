  Effects of animation retargeting on
  perceived action outcomes

post_excerpt: >
  The individual shape of the human body,
  including the geometry of its
  articulated structure and the
  distribution of weight over that
  structure, influences the kinematics of
  a person’s movements. How sensitive is
  the visual system to inconsistencies
  between shape and motion introduced by
  retargeting motion from one person onto
  the shape of another? We used optical
  motion capture to record five pairs of
  male performers with large differences
  in body weight, while they pushed,
  lifted, and threw objects. Based on a
  set of 67 markers, we estimated both the
  kinematics of the actions as well as the
  performer’s individual body shape. To
  obtain consistent and inconsistent
  stimuli, we created animated avatars by
  combining the shape and motion estimates
  from either a single performer or from
  different performers. In a virtual
  reality environment, observers rated the
  perceived weight or thrown distance of
  the objects. They were also asked to
  explicitly discriminate between
  consistent and hybrid stimuli. Observers
  were unable to accomplish the latter,
  but hybridization of shape and motion
  influenced their judgements of action
  outcome in systematic ways.
  Inconsistencies between shape and motion
  were assimilated into an altered
  perception of the action outcome.
