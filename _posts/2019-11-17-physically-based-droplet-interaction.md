post_title: Physically-based droplet interaction
author: gicomadmin
post_excerpt: >
  In this paper we present a
  physically-based model for simulating
  realistic interactions between liquid
  droplets in an efficient manner.Our
  particle-based system recreates the
  coalescence, separation and
  fragmentation interactions that occur
  between colliding liquid droplets and
  allows systems of droplets to be
  meaningfully represented by an
  equivalent number of simulated
  particles. By considering the
  interactions specific to liquid droplet
  phenomena directly,we display novel
  levels of detail that cannot be captured
  using other interaction models at a
  similar scale. Our work combines
  experimentally validated components,
  originating in engineering, with a
  collection of novel modifications to
  create a particle-based interaction
  model for use in the development of
  mid-to-large scale droplet-based liquid
  spray effects. We demonstrate this
  model, alongside a size-dependent drag
  force, as an extension to a
  commonly-used ballistic particle system
  and show how the introduction of these
  interactions improves the quality and
  variety of results possible in
  recreating liquid droplets and sprays,
  even using these otherwise simple
  systems
