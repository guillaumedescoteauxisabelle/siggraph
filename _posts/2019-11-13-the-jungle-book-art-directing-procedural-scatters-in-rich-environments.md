post_title: 'The Jungle Book: art-directing procedural scatters in rich environments'
author: gicomadmin
post_excerpt: >
  Disney’s live action remake of The
  Jungle Book required us to build
  photorealistic, organic and complex
  jungle environments. We developed a
  geometry distributor with which artists
  could dress a large number of very
  diverse CG sets. It was used in over 800
  shots to scatter elements, ranging from
  debris to entire trees. Per object
  attributes were conﬁgurable and the
  distribution was driven by procedural
  shaders and custom maps.
