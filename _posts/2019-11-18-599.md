  non-uniform probes in an efficient

  Our probe placement relies on 3D scene
  skeletons and a gradient descent-based
  refinement to achieve full geometric

  tracer caches visibility information in
  a sparse voxel octree, augmenting probes
  with metadata used to apply a
  hierarchical-Z acceleration when
  marching rays in distant probes. We
  benchmark our approach on a variety of
  scenes and consistently demonstrate
  better performance, and fewer probes, in
  equal-quality comparisons to the
  state-of-the-art.
