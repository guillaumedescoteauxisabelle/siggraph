  Efficient and robust skin slide

  Skin slide is the deformation effect
  where the outer surface moves along its
  tangent directions, caused by the
  stretching of other skin regions and/or
  the dynamic motion of the underlying
  tissues. Such an effect is essential for
  expressing natural deformations of
  humans, animals, and tightly-fitting
  costumes. Previous methods to achieve
  skin sliding were either manually
  controlled, or laborious to set up and
  expensive to compute. We present a
  novel, automated method to achieve
  convincing skin sliding with minimal
  set-up and run-time computation. Our
  method takes advantage of the recent
  developments in the elastic body
  simulations formulated as optimization
  using Alternating Direction Method of
  Multipliers (ADMM).This approach, which
  generalizes position-based and
  projective dynamics, allows intuitive
  integration of arbitrary constraints
  such as collision against the original
  deforming surface. The collision is
  accelerated and stabilized by taking
  advantage of the local nature of the
  sliding. To accelerate the convergence
  even further while respecting the
  artist-driven deformation, we propose a
  simple method to resume the simulation
  from the previous local
  parameterization. Various production
  results using a Maya deformer
  implementation of this technique prove
  its efficiency and competency.
