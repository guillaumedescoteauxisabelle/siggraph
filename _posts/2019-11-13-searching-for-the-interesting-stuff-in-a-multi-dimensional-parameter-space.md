  Searching for the interesting stuff in a
  multi-dimensional parameter space
author: gicomadmin
post_excerpt: >
  This talk describes work that I have
  been doing using generative systems and
  the problems this raises with how to
  deal with multidimensional parameter
  spaces. In particular I am interested in
  dealing with problems where there are
  too many parameters to do a simple
  exhaustive search, only a small number
  of parameter combinations are likely to
  achieve interesting results, but the
  user still wants to retain creative
  influence.
