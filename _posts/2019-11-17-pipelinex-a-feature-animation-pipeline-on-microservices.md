post_title: 'PipelineX: a feature animation pipeline on microservices'
author: gicomadmin
post_excerpt: >
  Here we present a unique approach to
  building a highly-scalable,
  multi-functional, and
  production-friendly feature animation
  pipeline on a core infrastructure
  comprised of microservices. We discuss
  basic service layer design as well as
  the benefits and challenges of moving
  decades-old production processes for an
  entire animation studio to a new,
  transactional pipeline operating against
  a compartmentalized technology stack.
  The goal is to clean up the clutter of a
  legacy pipeline and enable a more
  flexible production environment using
  modern, web-based technology.
