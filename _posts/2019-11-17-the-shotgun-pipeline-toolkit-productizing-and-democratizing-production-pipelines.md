post_title: 'The shotgun pipeline toolkit: productizing and democratizing production pipelines'
author: gicomadmin
post_excerpt: >
  This talk presents the motivations and
  goals for developing the Shotgun
  Pipeline Toolkit (Toolkit), a platform
  for building, customizing, and evolving
  production pipelines. We cover the
  challenges of developing a product that
  is valuable for studios of all types and
  sizes, supports common operating
  systems, and is easy to use; all while
  providing the flexibility and
  customizability required by creative
  studios. We will show the evolution of
  Toolkit from concept to release and the
  lessons learned trying to build pipeline
  components traditionally found only in
  studios with large development budgets.
  Finally, we look at recent work to
  reduce the barrier to entry to Toolkit
  as a step towards democratizing
  pipeline.
