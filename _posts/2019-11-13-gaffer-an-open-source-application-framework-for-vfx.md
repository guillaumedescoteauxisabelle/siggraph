post_title: 'Gaffer: an open-source application framework for VFX'
author: gicomadmin
post_excerpt: >
  Gaffer is an open-source application
  framework for visual effects production,
  which includes a multithreaded node
  based computation framework and a QT
  based UI framework for editing and
  viewing node graphs. The Gaffer
  frameworks were initiated independently
  by John Haddon in 2007, and have been
  used and extended in production at Image
  Engine since they were open-sourced in
  2011. They have become vital to nearly
  the entire Image Engine pipeline,
  forming the basis of any node-based
  system we choose to develop.
