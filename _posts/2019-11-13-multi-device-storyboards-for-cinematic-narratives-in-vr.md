  Multi-Device Storyboards for Cinematic
  Narratives in VR
author: gicomadmin
post_excerpt: >
  Virtual Reality (VR) narratives have the
  unprecedented potential to connect with
  an audience through presence, placing
  viewers within the narrative. The onset
  of consumer VR has resulted in an
  explosion of interest in immersive
  storytelling. Planning narratives for
  VR, however, is a grand challenge due to
  its unique affordances, its evolving
  cinematic vocabulary, and most
  importantly the lack of supporting tools
  to explore the creative process in VR.
