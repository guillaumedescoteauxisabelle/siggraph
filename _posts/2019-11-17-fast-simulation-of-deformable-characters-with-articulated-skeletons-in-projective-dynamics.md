  Fast simulation of deformable characters
  with articulated skeletons in projective
  dynamics

  We propose a fast and robust solver to
  simulate continuum-based deformable
  models with constraints, in particular,
  rigid-body and joint constraints useful
  for soft articulated characters. Our
  method embeds degrees of freedom of both
  articulated rigid bodies and deformable
  bodies in one unified optimization
  problem, thus coupling the deformable
  and rigid bodies. Our method can
  efficiently simulate character models,
  with rigid-body parts (bones) being
  correctly coupled with deformable parts
  (flesh). Our method is stable because
  backward Euler time integration is
  applied to rigid as well as deformable
  degrees of freedom. Our method is
  rigorously derived from constrained
  Newtonian mechanics. In an example
  simulation with rigid bodies only, we
  demonstrate that our method converges to
  the same motion as classical explicitly
  integrated rigid body simulator.
