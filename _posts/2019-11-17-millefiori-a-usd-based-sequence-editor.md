post_title: 'Millefiori: A USD-Based Sequence Editor'
author: gicomadmin
post_excerpt: 'Millefiori is a visual effects application designed to allow users to view and edit a series of large scenes, leveraging Pixar Universal Scene Description in its core, and Qt/QML for the UI components. While Millefiori was initiated as a sequence editor, its USD-based core has since formed the basis of the entire pipeline at Mill Film, from editing a USD stage to generating a review QuickTime. Development of the technology was a successful collaboration of developers led by Mill Film, MPC R&D, and Technicolor Research and Innovation.'
