  A robust volume conserving method for
  character-water interaction
author: gicomadmin
post_excerpt: >
  We propose a novel volume conserving
  framework for character-water
  interaction, using a novel
  volume-of-fluid solver on a skinned
  tetrahedral mesh, enabling the high
  degree of the spatial adaptivity in
  order to capture thin films and
  hair-water interactions. Forefficiency,
  the bulk of the fluid volume is
  simulated with a stan-dard Eulerian
  solver which is two way coupled to our
  skinned ar-bitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian
  mesh using a fast, robust, and
  straight-forward to implement
  partitioned approach. This allows for a
  spe-cialized and efficient treatment of
  the volume-of-fluid solver, sinceit is
  only required in a subset of the domain.
  The combination ofconservation of fluid
  volume and a kinematically deforming
  skinnedmesh allows us to robustly
  implement interesting effects such
  asadhesion, and anisotropic porosity. We
  illustrate the efficacy of our method by
  simulating various water effects with
  solid objects and animated characters
