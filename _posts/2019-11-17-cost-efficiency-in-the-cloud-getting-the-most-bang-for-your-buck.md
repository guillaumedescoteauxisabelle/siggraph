post_title: 'Cost efficiency in the cloud: getting the most bang for your buck!'
author: gicomadmin
post_excerpt: >
  Though it offers immense and undeniable
  compute scalability, cloud computing has
  a reputation for being more expensive
  than the local alternatives. But does it
  have to be? Weâ€™ll use data from visual
  effect company Atomic Fiction to look at
  cost optimization strategies such as
  using pre-emptible instances, cost
  limits, vertical vs. horizontal scaling,
  and selection of instance types, to
  provide examples of how those strategies
  can reduce production costs.
