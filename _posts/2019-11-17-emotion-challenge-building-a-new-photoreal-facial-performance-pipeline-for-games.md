post_title: 'Emotion challenge: building a new photoreal facial performance pipeline for games'
author: gicomadmin
post_excerpt: >
  In recent years the expected standard
  for facial animation and character
  performance in AAA video games has
  dramatically increased.The use of
  photogrammetric capture techniques for
  actor-likeness acquisition, coupled with
  video-based facial capture and solving
  methods, has improved quality across the
  industry. However, due to variability
  across project pipelines, increased
  per-project scope for performance
  capture, and a reliance on external
  vendors, it is often challenging to
  maintain visual consistency from project
  to project, and even from character to
  character within a single project.Given
  these factors, we identified the need
  for a unified, robust and scalable
  pipeline for actor likeness acquisition,
  character art,performance capture, and
  character animation
