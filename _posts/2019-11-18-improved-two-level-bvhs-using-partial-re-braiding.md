  Improved two-level BVHs using partial
  re-braiding
author: gicomadmin
post_excerpt: >
  We propose a novel approach for
  improving the quality of two-level BVHs
  (i.e., a two-level data structure that
  uses a top-level BVH built over
  second-level object BVHs). After
  building an individual, high-quality BVH
  for each object, our new top-level BVH
  build approach selectively re-braids
  (opens and merges) object BVHs during
  the build process to reduce overlap and
  improve SAH quality. We demonstrate that
  compared to the two main
  state-of-the-art
  techniques—brute-force re-construction
  of a single, flat BVH; and building a
  traditional two-level BVH over objects,
  respectively—the proposed approach
  achieves build times significantly
  faster than the former, while
  simultaneously yielding traversal
  performance that is much higher than the
  latter.
