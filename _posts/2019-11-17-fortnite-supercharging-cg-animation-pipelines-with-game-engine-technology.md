post_title: 'Fortnite: supercharging CG animation pipelines with game engine technology'
author: gicomadmin
post_excerpt: >
  Game engine technology, when applied to
  traditional linear animation production
  pipelines, can positively alter the
  dynamics of animated content creation.
  With realtime interactivity, the
  iterative revision process improves,
  flexibility during scene assembly
  increases, and rendering overhead is
  potentially eliminated.
